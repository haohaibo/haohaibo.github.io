<p>I am currently a Software Engineer at NVIDIA, where I contribute to TensorRT project.</p>

<p>Before NVIDIA, I was a  graduate research assistant at <a href="http://ncic.ac.cn/">NCIC Lab</a> <a href="http://www.ict.ac.cn/">ICT,CAS</a>, where I study parallel computing technics.</p>

<p>I obtained my master degree in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. I obtained my bachelor degree from <a href="https://www.xidian.edu.cn/">Xidian University, China</a>.</p>

<!--p>I have a track record of creating and contributing to open source libraries. In particular, I have been an active figure in the recent years' AI software stack designs: I am the creator of <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a>, which is now a <a href="http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BVLC</a> maintained, open-source deep learning framework. I've worked on the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> project at Google Brain. Recently, I have created and led the <a href="https://caffe2.ai/">Caffe2</a> and <a href="http://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> efforts. Caffe2 is one of the first deep learning frameworks to simultaneously provide high-performance AI capability on all major platforms (Cloud CPU/GPU, mobile CPU/GPU, embedded systems, etc.), and ONNX is an open standard for neural networks across the industry, creating collaboration among major players such as Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Qualcomm, ARM, and many more. Although I code less nowadays, I still serve as a humble contributor to the open source community with full heart.</p-->

<p>My major interest is on the design and evolution of AI hardware and software stack, joining the cutting edge research with the conventional wisdom of computer science.</p>
